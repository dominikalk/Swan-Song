You were approached by a strange man covering his face under the guise of a dark mask. He seemed to be using a voice changer when he approached you, saying he knew that you had fallen on hard times after leaving the military as a 8 year combat pilot veteran and that he could help you make large sums of cash in return for your military expertise. After being abandoned by the country that you were sworn to protect, you have no hard feelings about this mission. You feel that this is your swan song. Your final mission ...

This text based adventure game was made as part of a group project for University. The aim of the game is to steal as much money as you can in the time frame and escape the bank before you get caught by SWAT. To run the game you must have python 3 installed and run the following command in a CLI opened in the folder:

```
python game.py
```

The command 'python' may be different on your computer. For the best results have the CLI application opened in full screen. If at any point you need help, either go into the help part of the main menu or if you are already playing the game type in the command 'help'
